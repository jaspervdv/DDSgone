# DDSgone

DDSgone is a simple program that is made to support the livery creation process in Assetto Corsa Competizione. DDSgone will remove the dds files of a selected livery and force ACC to ignore DDS files temporarily. This allows for quicker updating of textures in the car selection window.

Run either the .exe or .py file and set the path to the folder that has the livery data (example path: ...\Documents\Assetto Corsa Competizione\Customs\Liveries\Porsche_991_GT3_SCB_Emilia). Start the game after starting the program. Do not close the program, minimize it.

After livery creation process is finished open the DDSgone window and press any key. The process will tell you when it is safe to exit. After the process has been executed restart ACC.

!!DO NOT CLOSE THE WINDOW BEFORE THE PROGRAM TELLS YOU TO!!

If you accidentally close DDSgone too early --> run DDSrestore and input the ACC root file folder (example path: ...\Documents\Assetto Corsa Competizione). After the process has been executed restart ACC.

The .exe is occasionally seen as a trojan, sorry about that, it is not
