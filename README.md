# DDSgone

DDSgone is a simple program that is made to support the livery creation process in Assetto Corsa Competizione. DDSgone will remove the dds files of a selected livery and force ACC to ignore DDS files temporarily. This allows for quicker updating of textures in the car selection window.

Run either the .exe or .py DDSgone file and set the path to the folder that has the livery data (example path: ...\Documents\Assetto Corsa Competizione\Customs\Liveries\Porsche_991_GT3_SCB_Emilia). Start the game after starting the program. Do not close the program, minimize it.

After livery creation process is finished open the DDSgone window and press any key. The process will tell you when it is safe to exit. After the process has been executed restart ACC.

!!DO NOT CLOSE THE WINDOW BEFORE THE PROGRAM TELLS YOU TO!!

If you accidentally close DDSgone too early --> run DDSrestore and set the path to the ACC root file folder (example path: ...\Documents\Assetto Corsa Competizione). After the process has been executed restart ACC.

To clean your liveries folder run the .exe or .py LFilter file and set the path to the ACC root file folder (example path: ...\Documents\Assetto Corsa Competizione). It will remove all the directories that do not contain files related to overlays (currently recognized overlay files: .png, .jpg, .dds). Make a backup of the liveries folder before use, this program will permanently remove folders and files. 

The .exe is occasionally seen as a trojan, sorry about that, it is not
