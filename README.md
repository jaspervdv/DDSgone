# DDSgone
Automatic DDS remover that will force ACC to ignore DDS files temporarily to ease the livery creation process.

Run either the .exe or .py file and set the path to the folder that has the livery data (example path: ...\Documents\Assetto Corsa Competizione\Customs\Liveries\Porsche_991_GT3_SCB_Emilia) . Start the game after starting the program. After livery creation process is finished open the DDSignore window and press any key. The process will tell you when it is safe to exit. After the process has been executed restart ACC.

!!DO NOT CLOSE THE WINDOW BEFORE THE PROGAM TELLS YOU TO!!
